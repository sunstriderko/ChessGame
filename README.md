ChessGame is a WPF application using .NET Core.

This Chess was created to practice WPF application and it's possibilities on bigger program than my Connect3 project. I also wanted to practice
designing a more complex application with way more functions and get better at debugging.

This application will work on any PC which supports .NET Core and is connected to the internet.
